Config options: (can be specified as url params, or a URL to a json object)

    root: 'url', // The root URL containing the mp3s or directories, if you don't provide a url, player will assume that
                // all urls in files are fully qualified
    files: [Array], // array of mp3 files. If set to 'scan', scan directory index (apache/nginx/s3)
    position: 'absolute|block|fixed',
    top: 0, // for position absolute, fixed
    left: 0, // for position absolute, fixed
    right: 0, // for position absolute, fixed
    bottom: 0, // for position absolute, fixed
    autoPlay: [boolean], // Start playing on load
    volume: [integer 0-100],
    repeat '[boolean]', // true to repeat the playlist from the beginning after the last track is finished playing
    closable: [boolean], //show close button
    collapsible: [boolean], //collapse to a 'mini' version
    collapsed: [boolean], //Initial collapsed state
    showPlaylist: [boolean], //Playlist is open or closed on startup
    playlistMode: [inline|floating],
    lazy: [boolean] //If true, load just enough of each file in playlist to determine id3 info and track length. Wait until track is played to load the entire file
                        //If false, load all files in playlist up front.
                        //Lazy loading may result in a perceived performance improvement, although total download size will be greater,
                        //since player has to load a portion of each file, then stop the download once meta info is retrieved, then when the file is played, redownload the entire file.




todo list:

- can't drag window if you click on TrackInfo panel in IE while playing.  Re-rendering the template removes the element, wiping out the event handlers
- play track on double click
- allow player to be initialized on Ext.onReady instead of soundManager.onready
- detect if flash is not installed and show download link
- implement floating vs inline playlist.
- test player both as a child component in a larger Ext layout, and rendered directly to the dom.
- fix button bug - in Firefox play/pause/next/prev buttons remain focused after clicking them.
    If you press space or enter on a focused button it has the same effect as clicking the button.
- if root or files param not provided, then run player in "local" mode - prompt user to load files from filesystem
- delete files from playlist
- add some events to the player in case someone wants to use it in a larger application.
- Track info panel displays default artist and title of "unknown" before id3 info is available. Is this the right behavior?
- create a custom build that only includes the neccessary Ext JS javascipt and css resources
- gracefully handle mp3 urls that return 404
- "widgetize" the player component


Ideas for future enhancements:
- modify the track slider to show percent loaded in addition to position
- sort/shuffle playlist
- drag and drop reorder playlist??
- add ability to configure playlist position.
- make player width configurable
